## Directions

### Dough

* Mix yeast with water, then add the flour, corn starch, sugar, and oil.
* Let rise for two hours. Cover with a wet paper towel.
* Add baking powder and gently incorporate into dough; add 1 - 2 tsp water if
  the dough is too dry.
* Let rise for 15min.
* Subdivide into 10 parts, then roll into a sheet ~4in diameter.

### Filling

* Saute onions in a dash of oil on medium-high heat until light golden.
* Add everything else for the sauce but the corn starch and let boil for ~30s to
  fully incorporate the onions.
* Scoop out onions and set heat to low.
* Add the cornstarch slurry (~3tbsp water) and mix until thickened.[^1]
* Stir in char siu until fully coated and let cool.

### Bao

* Steam on medium-high heat for ~12min and let rest for a couple of minutes.

#### Reheating

* Freeze uncooked buns, and steam for ~15min from frozen when ready to eat (i.e.
  do not thaw).

[^1]: Sauce will thicken a bit more after cooling down, so it's okay if it's
      still a bit runny at this stage. Just make sure it can coat the back of a
      spoon, etc.
