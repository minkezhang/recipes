#### Sauce

* 1/2 onion, diced
* 1tbsp char siu [marinade](char_siu.md)
* 2tbsp oyster sauce
* 1tsp dark soy sauce
* 1/2c chicken stock or water
* 1tbsp honey
* 2tbsp cornstarch

## Directions

### Dough

1. Mix yeast with water, then add the flour, corn starch, sugar, and oil.
1. Let rise for two hours. Cover with a wet paper towel.
1. Add baking powder and gently incorporate into dough; add 1 - 2 tsp water if
   the dough is too dry.
1. Let rise for 15min.
1. Subdivide into 10 parts, then roll into a sheet ~4in diameter.

### Filling

1. Saute onions in a dash of oil on medium-high heat until light golden.
1. Add everything else for the sauce but the corn starch and let boil for ~30s to
   fully incorporate the onions.
1. Scoop out onions and set heat to low.
1. Add the cornstarch slurry (~3tbsp water) and mix until thickened.[^1]
1. Stir in char siu until fully coated and let cool.

### Bao

1. Steam on medium-high heat for ~12min and let rest for a couple of minutes.

### Reheating

1. Freeze uncooked buns, and steam for ~16min from frozen when ready to eat (i.e.
   do not thaw).

[^1]: Sauce will thicken a bit more after cooling down, so it's okay if it's
      still a bit runny at this stage. Just make sure it can coat the back of a
      spoon, etc.
[^2]: Try with less corn starch -- 3/4c maybe. End result was too dry.
